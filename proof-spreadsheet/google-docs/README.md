# Google Sheets Proof Sheet
This sheet is designed to allow for quick trial and error of proofs, helping students to learn the ropes while keeping a neat and tidy workflow. 
Unfortunately, since it was written for the personal usage of the (lazy) writer most of the magic here is automatically filling the assumptions and the following required showlines. 
Of course this might be less then ideal for students wanting to use it to learn them for the first time, so maybe consider not using it until you've got a better practice with those rules.

## Installation
To use simply make a copy of the following [sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1b7vwRbddgI9EFyGMT_7VDkoDRKBldkhzJD34540Ghxo/edit?usp=sharing)

This should copy the helper scripts. If it does not, the sheet will not work 

## Problems

There is no way to integrate the capitalization into this sheet, so using this for predicate logic will require manual capitalization.
